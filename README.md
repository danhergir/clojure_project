## Clojure Project

__Projected created by: Daniel Hernandez__

This is a project created from the tutorial [How to write a Clojure app](https://www.exoscale.com/syslog/clojure-application-tutorial/). 

__Running project__

To run this project we're using [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) which is a popular way to manage Clojure projects and deals with the projectâ€™s release and dependency management for us. It serves as the entry point to your Clojure project as a developer.

To install __Leiningen__ or other dependencies you can go to the next tutorial [Installing Clojure dependencies](https://purelyfunctional.tv/guide/how-to-install-clojure/)

Once you have everything installed, all you have to do is going to the root of the project in your terminal and running the following command:

``` clojure 
lein run 
```
